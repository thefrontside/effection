# Effection

Structured concurrency and effects for JavaScript.

## Why use Effection?

Effection leverages the idea of [structured concurrency][structured concurrency]
to ensure that you don't leak any resources, effects, and that cancellation is
always properly handled. It helps you build concurrent code that feels rock
solid _at scale_, and it does all of this while feeling like normal JavaScript.

## Platforms

Effection runs on all major JavaScript platforms including NodeJs, Browser, and
Deno. It is published on both [npm][npm-effection] and [deno.land][deno-land-effection].

## Development

[Deno][] is the primary tool used for development, testing, and packaging.

### Testing

To run tests:

```text
$ deno task test
```

### Building NPM Packages

If you want to build a development version of the NPM package so that you can
link it locally, you can use the `build:npm` script and passing it a version
number. for example:

``` text
$ deno task build:npm 3.0.0-mydev-snapshot.0
Task build:npm deno run -A tasks/build-npm.ts "3.0.0-mydev-snapshot.0"
[dnt] Transforming...
[dnt] Running npm install...

up to date, audited 1 package in 162ms

found 0 vulnerabilities
[dnt] Building project...
[dnt] Emitting ESM package...
[dnt] Emitting script package...
[dnt] Complete!
```

Now, the built npm package can be found in the `build/npm` directory.
