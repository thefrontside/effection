For every tool in the `async/await` toolbox, there is an equilavent in
Effection. We were already introduced to the most important of these in
[the introduction][introduction].

|    Async        |     Effection         |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
|`Promise`        | `Operation`           |
|`await`          | `yield*`              |
|`async function` | `function*`           |


Likewise, there are also equivalents for the
[Async iteration protocols][async-iteration-protocols].
They are:

|    Async        |     Effection         |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
|`AsyncIterator`  | `Subscription`        |
|`AsyncIterable`  | `Stream`              |
|`for await`      | `for yield*`          |


If you're familiar with how to use these constructs, then you will be right at
home working with sequences of data in Effection. In particular, streams are
useful for modeling things like UI events and network connections, and in this
guide we'll see how to create, transform, and consume them.

## Subscription

The Effection equivalent of [`AsyncIterator`][async-iterator] is the
[`Subscription`][subscription]. Like its async counterpart, a
subscription acts like a queue that provides a sequence of values via a
`next()` method. The only difference is that instead of returning a
`Promise` that _fulfills_ to an iterator result, it returns an
[`Operation`][operation] that _yields_ an iterator result.

```ts
function* forEach(subscription) {
  let next = yield* subscription.next();
  while (!next.done) {
    console.log(`value: ${next.value}`);
    next = yield* subscription.next();
  }
  console.log(`done: ${next.value}`);
}
```

Subscriptions, like async iterators, are stateful objects, and calling
the `next()` method on them alters their internal state. Crucially,
taking the next value from the subscription not only retrieves that
value, but also removes it, so that we don't iterate the same value twice.

Just as with async interators, subscriptions are low-level constructs that you
don't interact with all that often, but it is good to know that they are there.
Most of the time however, instead of working with subscriptions directly, you'll
work with streams.

## Stream

Streams are the Effection equivalent of [async iterables][async-iteration-protocols],
and like them, are  _stateless objects_ that does not do anything by
themselves. Whereas a `Subscription` represents hot, active state, a
[`Stream`][stream] on the other hand contains a _recipe_ on how to create
a subscription.

A Stream can have _any number of subscriptions_, each of which receives
the same set of values. Effection ships with [`Channel`][channel], which is
a very handy way to create streams and by proxy, subscriptions. Let's use this
to show the difference between them:

``` javascript
import { main, createChannel } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let channel = createChannel();

  // the channel has no subscribers yet!
  yield* channel.send('too early');

  let subscription1 = yield* channel;
  let subscription2 = yield* channel;

  yield* channel.send('hello');
  yield* channel.send('world');

  console.log(yield* subscription1.next());
  //=> { done: false, value: "hello" }
  console.log(yield* subscription1.next());
  //=> { done: false, value: "world" }
  console.log(yield* subscription2.next());
  //=> { done: false, value: "hello" }
  console.log(yield* subscription2.next());
  //=> { done: false, value: "world" }
});
```

As you can see, the channel can have multiple subscribers and sending a message
to the channel adds it to each active subscription. If the channel does not
have any active subscriptions, then sending a message to it does nothing.

## for yield* each

The entire point of having a stream is to consume values from it, and we
have already seen how we can use `yield*` to subscribe to a Stream and turn
a Stream into a Subscription. But there is an easier way!

When working with an async iterator, you would not normally traverse it by
manually invoking the `next()` method repeatedly. Instead, you would use the
[`for await of`][asynchronous iterators] syntax to conveniently focus on the
work to be done with each item instead of the mechanics of iteration.
It is the same with Effection streams.

The simplest way to consume a stream in Effection is with the `for
yield* each` loop. It is almost identical to the `for await` loop from
`async/await`. The biggest difference is that you _must_ yield to the
`each.next` operation as the last step of your loop.

``` javascript
import { main, createChannel, each, spawn, sleep } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let channel = createChannel();

  yield* spawn(function*() {
    yield* sleep(1000);
    yield* channel.send('hello');
    yield* sleep(1000);
    yield* channel.send('world');
  });

  for (let value of yield* each(channel)) {
    console.log('got value:', value);
    yield* each.next();
  }
```

Why do we need to use `spawn()` here? We know that sending values to a
stream does nothing unless someone is subscribed to the stream, so we
cannot send any values before we begin our loop, but we also cannot
send any values *after* we begin our loop because the loop will never
complete until the stream closes (more about that later). So we need
to run both the loop _and_ the sending of values concurrently, and as
we've already learned, when we need to do multiple things
concurrently, that's when we use `spawn()`.

We could also flip this example around like this:

``` javascript
import { main, createChannel, next, spawn, sleep } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let channel = createChannel();

  yield* spawn(function*() {
    for (let value of yield* each(channel)) {
      console.log('got value:', value);
      yield* each.next();
    }
  });

  yield* sleep(1000);
  yield* channel.send('hello');
  yield* sleep(1000);
  yield* channel.send('world');
});
```

## Why Subscriptions?

Unlike listening for one-off events, a subscription guarantees
that we can never miss any messages. We can see how a subscription
will not drop a message even though it may receive deliveries even while
the consumer is doing other things:

``` javascript
import { main, createChannel, spawn, sleep } from 'effection';

await main(function*() {
  let channel = createChannel();

  let subscription = yield* channel;

  yield* spawn(function*() {
    yield* sleep(1000);
    yield* channel.send('hello');
    yield* channel.send('world');
  });

  let { value: firstValue } = yield* subscription.next();
  console.log(firstValue); // logs 'hello'

  yield* sleep(1000);

  let { value: secondValue } = yield* subscription.next();
  console.log(secondValue); // logs 'world'
});
```

## Closing streams

All good things must come to an end, including a stream of data. In these cases
Effection streams and subscriptions optionally support passing a final piece of
data when there are no more values to be received.  Usually, if present, this
piece of data represents a summary of the stream and something about its final
end state. For example, when a websocket is closed it emits a
[`close` event][close-event] that contains a numeric code and a description of
why the socked was closed.

The value of this last piece of data is the value of the iterator result when
the `done` attribute is true. Unsurprisingly, this mirrors the behavior of an
async iterator exactly.

```js
import { main, sleep, spawn, createChannel } from "effection";

await main(function*() {
  let channel = createChannel();

  let subscription = yield* channel;

  yield* spawn(function*() {
    yield* channel.send('hello');
    yield* sleep(1000);
    yield* channel.send('hello');
    yield* channel.close({ words: 2 });
  });

  let next = yield* subscription.next();

  while (!next.done) {
    console.log(next.value);
    next = yield* subscription.next();
  }

  console.log(`${next.value} words total`);
});

//=> hello
//=> world
//=> 2 words total
```

Just like with an async iterator, if you want to access the very last iterator
result, you cannot use the `for...of`. You _must_ use a `while-loop`. This is
because the body of the loop only executes for iterator result where the `done`
property is `false`. It does _not_ execute for the last iterator result where
`done` is true.

## Creating your own streams

Most of the examples thus far have shown how to consume streams that
are originated from within an operation, and so have used the
preferred mechanism for that which is the [Channel][channel]. To do
this, we run the channel's `send()` operation. But because `send()` is
an operation, it means that in order to send a message to the stream,
we must already have to be inside an operation. However, this poses a
problem for events that originate from _outside_ of an operation such
as an event listener. In this case, we need to be able to call a plain
vanilla javascript function which is not an operation, and still
notify any subscribers to a stream. For these cases there is the
[`Signal`][signal] interface which can be created with
[`createSignal`](createSignal) function.

In the following example, we use a signal as an event callback to log
all of the events


```javascript
import { createSignal, each } from "effection";

export function* logClicks(button) {
  let clicks = createSignal();
  try {
    button.addEventListener("click", clicks.send);

    for (let click of yield* each(clicks)) {
      console.dir({ click });
      yield* each.next();
    }
  } finally {
    button.removeEventListener("click", clicks.send);
  }
}
```

First, we create the signal, then attach its `send()` function to the
event target's callback. It then loops over every click event received
in this way and logs out its contents to the console. Notice that,
like a well-behaved operation, we make sure to uninstall the listener
on the button so that we left it in the same state we found it.

This is a good demonstration of the concept, but it isn't as useful as
it could be because any time we want to do something like the above to
consume a stream of clicks, we'd first need to create a signal, attach
the signal's callback, and then iterate over its content. For example,
if we wanted to make an operation that disabled a button by preventing
the default action every time, we would have to regurgitate the same
boilerplate code as in our click logger:

```javascript
import { createSignal, each } from "effection";

export function* cancelClicks(button) {
  let clicks = createSignal();
  try {
    button.addEventListener("click", clicks.send);

    for (let click of yield* each(clicks)) {
      click.preventDefault();
      yield* each.next();
    }
  } finally {
    button.removeEventListener("click", clicks.send);
  }
}
```

In other words, the problem with this method, is that you have to
define the stream and consume it in the same place. But what we'd like
to do instead is to define the stream in one place, but consume it in
another. That way, we could specify the setup and teardown logic once,
but utilize it multiple times. If we had a way to do that, say a `clicksOn()`
function that could take any html element and return a stream of clicks on that
element, then we could write something like the following:

```javascript
function* logAndCancel(button) {
  let clicks = clicksOn(button);

  yield* spawn(function*() {
    for (let click of yield* each(clicks)) {
      console.log(click);
      yield* each.next();
    }
  })

  yield* spawn(function*() {
    for (let click of yield* each(clicks)) {
      click.preventDefault();
      yield* each.next();
    }
  });
}
```

It turns out that [resources][resources] are just what we need to make
this happen. If you recall, a [`Stream`][stream] is just an
[`Operation`][operation] that returns a
[`Subscription`][subscription]. So the simplest way to implement such
an operation is as a _resource that provides a subscription_.

>💡Most of the time, you won't need to implement your own streams, but when you
> do, a resource is the easiest way to do it.

Armed with resources, we can now implement our hypothetical `clicksOn` utility.

```javascript
import { resource } from "effection"

export function clicksOn(button) {
  return resource(function*(provide) {
    let clicks = createSignal();
    try {
      button.addEventListener("click", clicks.send);

      let subscription = yield* clicks;
      yield* provide(subscription);

    } finally {
      button.removeEventListener("click", send);
    }
  });
}
```

We have now encapsulated the setup and teardown of our listener in a single
place, but the actual consuming of the stream of clicks can happen anywhere.

In fact, Effection provides a handy way to create a stream of events out of any
[`EventTarget`][event-target] using the built in [`on()`][on] function, and this is
precisely the technique that it uses. You can read more about using event
targets in the next section.
