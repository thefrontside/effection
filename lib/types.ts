/**
 * An `Operation` in Effection describes an abstract computation. An operation
 * does not do anything on its own. Rather, it only describes the steps it will
 * take when it runs.
 *
 * In the Effection world, `Operation` occupies the same position as `Promise`
 * does the world of async/await.
 *
 * An operation can be created with a generator function that only does `yield*`
 * to other operations:
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * import { sleep } from "effection";

 * function* slow5(seconds) {
 *   yield* sleep(seconds * 1000);
 *   return 5;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Operations can also be created using `Symbol.iterator`. The following
 * operation is the same as above:
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * import { sleep } from "effection";
 *
 * const slow5 = (seconds) => ({
 *   *[Symbol.iterator]() {
 *     yield* sleep(seconds * 1000);
 *     return 5;
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * See [Operations guide](https://frontside.com/effection/v3/docs/operations) for more information.

/**
 * A value that is both an {@link Operation} _and_ `Promise`.
 *
 * Futures are operations that are implicitly associated with an Effection scope
 * and so they can be freely `await`ed within any async functions. However, they
 * can also be evaluated directly within another operation, so among other
 * things, if the operation resolves synchronously, it will continue within the
 * same tick of the run loop.

/**
 * A handle to a concurrently running operation that lets you either use the
 * result of that operation, or shut it down.
 *
 * When it is run or spawned, an operation executes concurrently with
 * the rest of the program. The `Task` is both an {@link Operation} and a
 * `Promise` that lets you consume the result of that operation.
 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * import { run, sleep } from "effection";
 *
 * let task = run(function*() {
 *   yield* sleep(100);
 *   return "hello world"
 * });
 *
 * console.log(await task); //=> "hello world"
 * ```
 *
 * A task can also be created from within an operation by using the
 * {@link spawn()} operation.
 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * import { run, spawn, sleep } from "effection";
 *
 * await run(function*() {
 *   let task = yield* spawn(function*() {
 *     yield* sleep(100);
 *     return "hello world";
 *   });
 *   console.log(yield* task;) //=> "hello world"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Note tasks are subject to the strict guarantees of structured concurrency
 * and will never outlive their parent. For example, the following spawned task
 * will never log any output to the console.
 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * import { run, spawn, sleep } from "effection";
 *
 * await run(function*() {
 *   yield* spawn(function*() {
 *     yield* sleep(100);
 *     console.log("hello world");
 *   });
 *   // <--- returns here, so spawned task is shut down as it sleeps.
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * See the guide on [Scopes](https://frontside.com/effection/docs/scope) for
 * more detail.
 *
 * If a `Task` is halted before it finishes executing, then consuming it's
 * result is an Error.
 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * import { run, spawn, sleep } from "effection";
 *
 * await run(function*() {
 *  let task = yield* spawn(function*() {
 *    yield* sleep(100);
 *    return "hello world";
 *  });
 *  yield* task.halt();
 *  let output = yield* task; //=> throws Error("halted");
 *  console.log(output);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link run}
 * @see {@link spawn}
 * @see {@link Scope.run}
