        <Feature summary="👩🏻‍💻 100% JavaScript">
          No build steps. No esoteric APIs, and no new odd-ball paradigms to
          learn; Effection leans into JavaScript's natural constructs at every
          turn, so code always feels intuitive.
        </Feature>

        <Feature summary="🛡️ Leak proof">
          Effection code cleans up after itself, and that means never having to
          remember to manually close a resource or detach a listener.
        </Feature>
        <Feature summary="🖐️ Halt any operation">
          An Effection operation can be shut down at any moment which will not
          only stop it completely but also stop any other operations that it
          started.
        </Feature>
        <Feature summary="🔒 Synchronicity">
          Unlike Promises and async/await, Effection is fundamentally
          synchronous in nature, which means you have full control over the
          event loop and operations requiring synchronous setup remain race
          condition free.
        </Feature>
        <Feature summary="🎹 Seamless composition">
          Since all Effection code is well behaved, it clicks together easily,
          and there are no nasty surprises when fitting different pieces
          together.
        </Feature>
