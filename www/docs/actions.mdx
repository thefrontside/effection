In this section, we'll cover the first two fundamental operations in Effection:
`suspend()` and `action()`, and how we can use them in tandem to serve as a safe
alternative to the [Promise constructor][promise-constructor].

## Suspend

Simple in concept, yet bearing enormous practical weight, the `suspend()`
operation is fundamental to Effection. It pauses the current
operation until it [passes out of scope][scope], at which point it will return
immediately.

Let's revisit our simplified sleep operation from the [introduction to
operations](./operations):

```js
export function sleep(duration) {
  return action(function* (resolve) {
    let timeoutId = setTimeout(resolve, duration);
    try {
      yield* suspend();
    } finally {
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    }
  });
}
```

As we saw, no matter how the sleep operation ends, it always executes the
`finally {}` block on its way out; thereby clearing out the `setTimeout`
callback.

It's worth noting that we say the suspend operation will return immediately,
we really mean it. The operation will proceed to return from the suspension
point via _as direct a path as possible_, as though it were returning a value.

```js {6}
export function sleep(duration) {
  return action(function* (resolve) {
    let timeoutId = setTimeout(resolve, duration);
    try {
      yield* suspend();
      console.log('you will never ever see this printed!');
    } finally {
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    }
  });
}
```

If we wanted to replicate our `sleep()` functionality with promises, we'd need
to do something like accept an [`AbortSignal`][abort-signal] as a second
argument to `sleep()`, and then use it to prevent our event-loop callback from
leaking:

```js
export function sleep(duration, signal) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    if (signal.aborted) {
      resolve();
    } else {
      let timeoutId = setTimeout(resolve, duration);
      signal.addEventListener("abort", () => clearTimeout(timeoutId));
    }
  });
}
```

This functions properly, but is ham-fisted. Not only is the
implementation non-obvious, but it's also cumbersome to use in
practice because it involves first creating a signal, passing it
around explicitly to everything, and then finally firing it manually when the
program is over:

```js
let controller = new AbortController();
let { signal } = controller;

await Promise.all([sleep(10, signal), sleep(1000, signal)]);

controller.abort();
```

With a suspended action on the other hand, we get all the benefit as if
an abort signal was there without sacrificing any clarity in achieving it.

Most often, [but not always][spawn-suspend], you encounter `suspend()` in the
context of an action as the pivot between that action's setup and teardown.

## Actions

The second fundamental operation, [`action()`][action], serves two
purposes. The first is to adapt callback-based APIs and make them available as
operations. In this regard, it is very much like the
[promise constructor][promise-constructor]. To see this correspondance, let's
use [one of the examples from MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/Promise#examples)
that uses promises to make a crude replica of the global [`fetch()`][fetch]
function. It manually creates an XHR, and hooks up the `load` and `error` events
to the `resolve` and `reject` functions respectively.

```js
async function fetch(url) {
  return await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("GET", url);
    xhr.onload = () => resolve(xhr.responseText);
    xhr.onerror = () => reject(xhr.statusText);
    xhr.send();
  });
}
```

Consulting the [Async Rosetta Stone](async-rosetta-stone), we can substitute the async
constructs for their Effection counterparts to arrive at a line for line
translation.

```js
function* fetch(url) {
  return yield* action(function*(resolve, reject) {
    let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("GET", url);
    xhr.onload = () => resolve(xhr.responseText);
    xhr.onerror = () => reject(xhr.statusText);
    xhr.send();
  });
}
```

While this works works every bit as well as the promise based
implementation, it turns out that the example from MDN has a subtle
bug. In fact, it's the same subtle bug that afflicted the "racing
sleep" example in the [introduction to
operations](http://localhost:8000/docs/operations#cleanup). If
we no longer care about the outcome of our `fetch` operation, we will
"leak" its http request which will remain in flight until a response
is received. In the example below it does not matter which web request
"wins" the race to fetch the current weather, our process cannot exit
until _both_ requests are have received a response.

```js
await Promise.race([
  fetch("https://openweathermap.org"),
  fetch("https://open-meteo.org")
])
```

With Effection, this is easily fixed by suspending the operation, and making
sure that the request is cancelled when it is either resolved, rejected, or
passes out of scope.

```js {8-12} showLineNumbers
function* fetch(url) {
  return yield* action(function*(resolve, reject) {
    let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("GET", url);
    xhr.onload = () => resolve(xhr.responseText);
    xhr.onerror = () => reject(xhr.statusText);
    xhr.send();
    try {
      yield* suspend();
    } finally {
      xhr.abort();
    }
  });
}
```

As we've seen, actions can do anything that a promise can do (and more safely
at that), but they also have a super power that promises do not. If you recall
from the very beginning of this article, a key difference in Effection is that
operations are values which, unlike promises, do not represent runtime state.
Rather, they are "recipes" of what to do, and in order to do them, they need to
be run either explicitly with `run()` or by including them with `yield*`.

This means that when every operation runs, it is bound to an explicit
lexical context; which is a fancy way of saying that ___running an
operation can only ever return control to a single location___. A
promise on the other hand, because it accepts an unlimited number of
callbacks via `then()`, `catch()`, and `finally()`, can return control
to an unlimited number of locations. This may seem a small thing, but
it is very powerful. To demonstrate, consider the following set of
nested actions.

```js
await run(function* () {
  yield* action(function* (resolve) {
    try {
      yield* action(function*() {
        try {
          yield* action(function*() { resolve() });
        } finally {
          console.log('inner')
        }
      });
    } finally {
      console.log('middle');
    }
  });
  console.log('outer');
});
```

When we run it, it outputs the strings `inner`, `middle`, and `outer` in order.
Notice however, that we never actually resolved the inner actions, only the
outer one, and yet every single piece of teardown code is executed as expected
as the call stack unwinds and it proceeds back to line 2. This means you can use
actions to "capture" a specific location in your code as an "escape point" and
return to it an any moment, but still feel confident that you won't leak any
effects when you do.

Let's consider a slightly more practical example of when this functionality
could come in handy. Let's say we have a bunch of numbers scattered across the
network that we want to fetch and multiply together. We want to write an
to muliply these numbers that will use a list of operations that retreive the
numbers for us.

In order to be time efficient we want to fetch all the numbers
concurrently so we use the [`all()`][all] operation. However, because
this is multiplication, if any one of the numbers is zero, then the
entire result is zero, so if at any point we discover that there is a
`0` in any of the inputs to the computation, there really is no
further point in continuing because the answer will be zero no matter
how we slice it. It would save us time and money if there were a
mechanism to "short-circuit" the operation and proceed directly to
zero, and in fact there is!

The answer is with an action.

```ts
import { action, all } from "effection";

export function multiply(...operations) {
  return action(function* (resolve) {
    let fetchNumbers = operations.map(operation => function* () {
      let num = yield* operation;
      if (num === 0) {
        resolve(0);
      }
      return num;
    });

    let values = yield* all(fetchNumbers);

    let result = values.reduce((current, value) => current * value, 1);

    resolve(result);
  });
}
```

We wrap each operation that retrieves a number into one that _immediately_
ejects from the entire action with a result of zero the _moment_ that any zero
is detected in _any_ of the results. The action will yield zero, but before
returning control back to its caller, it will ensure that all outstanding
requests are completely shutdown so that we can be guaranteed not to leak any
effects.
