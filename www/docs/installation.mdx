Effection can be used in any JavaScript environment including Deno, Node and browsers. Effection packages are side-effect free and do not pollute your environment in any way, making it compatible with most JavaScript runtimes.
If you encounter obstacles integrating with your environment, please create a [GitHub Issue in the Effection repository](https://github.com/thefrontside/effection/issues/new).

## Node.js

Effection packages are available via NPM and Yarn. The package includes ESM, CommonJS and TypeScript types.

```bash
// install with npm
npm install effection@next

// install with yarn
yarn add effection@next
```

## Deno

Effection has first-class Deno support because it's written in Deno. We publish NPM/Yarn packages from our [Deno package](https://deno.land/x/effection@3.0.0-beta.1). <small>If you're curious how we keep NPM/YARN and Deno packages in-sync, you can [checkout the blog post on how publish Deno packages to NPM.](https://frontside.com/blog/2023-04-27-deno-is-the-easiest-way-to-author-npm-packages/).</small>

```ts
import { main } from 'https://deno.land/x/effection@3.0.0-beta.1/mod.ts';
```
