/**
 * An `Operation` in Effection describes an abstract computation. An operation
 * does not do anything on its own. Rather, it only describes the steps it will
 * take when it runs.
 *
 * In the Effection world, `Operation` occupies the same position as `Promise`
 * does the world of async/await.
 *
 * An operation can be created with a generator function that only does `yield*`
 * to other operations:
 *
 * ```js
 * import { sleep } from "effection";

 * function* slow5(seconds) {
 *   yield* sleep(seconds * 1000);
 *   return 5;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Operations can also be created using `Symbol.iterator`. The following
 * operation is the same as above:
 *
 * ```js
 * import { sleep } from "effection";
 *
 * const slow5 = (seconds) => ({
 *   *[Symbol.iterator]() {
 *     yield* sleep(seconds * 1000);
 *     return 5;
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * See [Operations guide](https://frontside.com/effection/v3/docs/operations) for more information.
