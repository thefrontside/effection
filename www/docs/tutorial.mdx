Let's write our first program using Effection.

``` javascript
import { call, useAbortSignal } from "effection";

export function* fetchWeekDay(timezone) {
  let signal = yield* useAbortSignal();

  let response = yield* call(fetch(`http://worldclockapi.com/api/json/${timezone}/now`, { signal }));

  let time = yield* call(response.json());

  return time.dayOfTheWeek;
}
```

To start using Effection, use the `main` function as an entry
point. In this example, we'll use the previously defined
`fetchWeekDay`.

```javascript
import { main } from 'effection';
import { fetchWeekDay } from './fetch-week-day';

await main(function*() {

  let dayOfTheWeek = yield* fetchWeekDay('est');
  
  console.log(`It is ${dayOfTheWeek}, my friends!`);
});
```

Even with such a simple program, Effection is still providing critical
power-ups that you don't get with callbacks,
promises, or `async/await`. For example, notice how the Effection
`fetchWeekDay()` operation does not accept an abort signal as a second argument.
That's because there is no need to manually wire up any signal handlers and
trigger an `AbortController` at the right time.

If you run the above code in NodeJS and hit `CTRL-C` while the request
to `http://worldclockapi.com` is still in progress, it will properly
cancel the in-flight request as a well-behaved HTTP client should. All
without you ever having to think about it. This is because every
Effection operation contains the information on how to dispose of
itself, and so the actual act of cancellation can be automated.

This has powerful consequences when it comes to composing new
operations out of existing ones. For example, we can add a time out of
1000 milliseconds to our `fetchWeekDay` operation (or any operation
for that matter) by wrapping it in a `withTimeout` operation.

```javascript
import { main, call, race } from 'effection';
import { fetchWeekDay } from './fetch-week-day';

await main(function*() {
  let dayOfTheWeek = yield* withTimeout(fetchWeekDay('est'), 1000);
  console.log(`It is ${dayOfTheWeek}, my friends!`);
});

function withTimeout(operation, delay) {
  return race([operation, call(function*() {
    yield* sleep(delay);
    throw new Error(`timeout!`);
  })]);
}
```

If more than 1000 milliseconds passes before the `fetchWeekDay()`
operation completes, then an error will be raised.

What's important to note however, is that when we actually defined our
`fetchWeekDay()` operation, we never once had to worry about timeouts,
or request cancellation. And in order to achieve both we didn't have
to gum up our API by passing around cancellation tokens or [abort
controllers][abort controller]. We just got it all for free.
